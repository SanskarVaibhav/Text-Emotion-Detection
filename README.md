**Text Emotion Detection**

A machine learning project to detect emotions from text using Python.

**Dataset Used**
 1. Source: The dataset is located in the data/ directory.

 2. Description: It likely contains labeled text samples with corresponding emotion tags (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, etc.).
    (If you know the exact dataset, e.g., Kaggle's Emotion Dataset, specify it here.)

**Approach Summary**

1.Preprocessing:
  a.Text data is cleaned and tokenized.
  b.Stopwords removal and lowercasing are applied.

2.Feature Extraction:
  a.Text features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.

3.Modeling:
  a.A machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or a simple Neural Network) is trained on the processed features to predict the emotion label.

4.Deployment:
  a.The trained model is deployed via a simple web app using app.py, allowing users to input text and receive emotion predictions.

**Dependencies**

1.To run this project, install the following Python packages:

  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask

2.If Jupyter Notebooks are used, also install:

pip install notebook

**How to Run**
1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SanskarVaibhav/Text-Emotion-Detection.git
cd Text-Emotion-Detection

2.Install dependencies:
